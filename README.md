- 👋 Hi, I’m @bhoerner, or Brittany
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Learning new things. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, HTML/CSS, attempting Kotlin
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't know
- 📫 How to reach me ... brittanyhoerner@yahoo.com

Right now I'm just learning in my spare time. I'm going to be using this as a way to show my friends/family the things that I'm learning.

I'm autistic, and have ADHD. I am not medicated for the ADHD, so I'm usually all over the place with my learning.<br>
No I'm not a super robot. My memory sucks, and I learn at a slower pace.<br>
I love computers, and thought it would be fun to try to learn some web stuff and programming.<br>
<br>
My main hobby is crafting, mostly crochet. If I am able to create anything in the future there is a good chance that I'll add in some crafting elements to it.
